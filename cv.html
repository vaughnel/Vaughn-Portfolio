                            <p>I considered myself so lucky to had Vaughnel as the Group Coordinator for our office at Flight Centre. He is The Guy, when it comes to the day to day operational aspect and Leadership! I have never seen someone juggle so many tasks, but still be efficient and patient. Vaughnel is very prompt, professional, and attentive. He has a strong can-do attitude that is contagious. He has a unique and positive approach that is amazing to watch with all types of personalities. As my colleague, co-worker, and leader, Vaughnel gets my highest Recommendation, your company will be so lucky to have him.</p>

                            <p>"Invaluable asset" is the phrase that comes to mind when reflecting on the time I was fortunate enough to share while working with Vaughnel. Between his devotion to success, his constant collaborative efforts, and infectious positivity, he is vital to any organization. Vaughnel and I partnered coast to coast on Business Development efforts. I was particularly impressed, and often inspired, by his organizational skills and time management. Overseeing a multitude of projects at any given time, he consistently shows punctuality, professionalism, and poise. Vaughnel has earned my highest praise and recommendation, and any company will have struck the lottery with him on their team</p>

                        <p><b>Senior Sales Operations Manager</b></p>
                        <li>
                            <p>I cannot speak highly enough about Vaughnel Fletcher. It wasn’t long in our acquaintance before he became one of my favorite people. Although we had only a short time working together, it was readily apparent that Vaughnel is the full package; calm sense of urgency, efficient, aware and curious, enthusiastic, patient, bright, curious, kind, and of course, hilariously funny. I would recommend Vaughnel for any workplace as he brings a wide array of learned skills and adapts easily - his ability to quickly onboard and ramp up to speed are impressive - however it is his work with people where he truly shines. It was a privilege to work with this young man and I am excited to see what comes next on his meteoric rise.</p>
